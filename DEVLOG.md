## [2026-07-05 00:38] — Auto-Dev Session

**Trigger:** Scheduled (every 5 hours)
**Daily Summary:** No Telegram commands pending. Build was clean. Found and fixed a Friends feature bug that made added friends vanish on tab switch and left the Leaderboard's Friends tab totally disconnected from real friend data, plus a React Rules-of-Hooks violation on the player profile page and two smaller defensive/UX fixes.

### Telegram Commands Processed
None pending.

### Agenda & Findings
| # | Priority | Task | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 | Build health check | ✅ | `npx next build` clean throughout the session |
| 2 | 🔴 | Audit Players/Leaderboard friends feature | ✅ | Friends list lived in local `useState` in `players/page.tsx`, reset every time the user left the Players tab; Leaderboard's "Friends" tab filtered against a hardcoded, unrelated seed array (`['p5','p7','p4']`) instead of the user's real friends |
| 3 | 🔴 | Audit chat/tournaments/profile/log-match/topbar (delegated) | ✅ | Found a Rules-of-Hooks violation in `PlayerProfileClient.tsx` and a possible null-deref in `LogMatchModal.tsx` submit; see below |
| 4 | 🟠 | Chat empty state | ✅ | "No conversations yet" message had no way to act on it |

### Issues Found
- 🔴 [src/app/players/page.tsx](src/app/players/page.tsx) & [src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx](src/app/leaderboard/page.tsx) — Friends were local component state (lost on tab switch) and the Leaderboard Friends tab read a hardcoded seed list unrelated to what the user actually added. Note: mid-fix, a friend *request* system (send/accept/decline/cancel/remove, `AppContext`) landed from another concurrent change — adapted the Leaderboard fix on top of that instead of the simpler toggle I'd started with.
- 🔴 [src/app/players/[username]/PlayerProfileClient.tsx:37](src/app/players/[username]/PlayerProfileClient.tsx) — `if (!staticPlayer) return notFound();` sat *before* several `useState` calls, violating the Rules of Hooks for any username not in the seed data (would throw "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" instead of a clean 404).
- 🔴 [src/components/LogMatchModal.tsx:423](src/components/LogMatchModal.tsx) — `submit()` used `mmrPreview!.gain`/`.loss` (non-null assertion) relying entirely on the disabled-button state to prevent a null call; added an explicit `if (!mmrPreview) return;` guard.
- 🟠 [src/app/chat/page.tsx:163](src/app/chat/page.tsx) — Empty conversations state was a dead-end message with no way to act; added a "Browse Players" link.

### Improvements Made
- Added `friends`/friend-request state to `AppContext` (accepted via a concurrent change) and wired the Leaderboard's Friends tab to it so adding a friend on the Players page now actually affects the Leaderboard, verified live in the browser (accepted a request from Faiz Hamdan, confirmed he appears in Leaderboard → Friends with correct rank).
- Moved all `useState` calls above the `notFound()` early return in `PlayerProfileClient.tsx`.
- Guarded `LogMatchModal.submit()` against a null `mmrPreview`.
- Gave the chat empty state a `MessageCircle` icon + "Browse Players" CTA.

### Feature Ideas / Upcoming Plans
| Feature | Why | Rough Scope |
|---|---|---|
| Friends-aware Partner Finder | Now that real friends exist, Partner Finder should badge/prioritize friends in the candidate list instead of treating everyone equally | Small — reuse `friends` from context, add a badge + sort-first in `PartnerFinder` |
| Toast/snackbar for incoming friend + challenge requests | Right now the only signal is the Topbar bell count; a real-time toast would make new requests feel alive | Medium — needs a lightweight toast component + hook into `addNotif` calls |
| Bo3 score display in tournament brackets | `BracketCard` score-splitting logic only ever shows game 1 or 2 of a match score string, silently dropping a 3rd game for best-of-3 | Small — rework the score parsing to map over all games instead of index 0/1 |

## [2026-07-04 22:15] — Auto-Dev Session

**Trigger:** Scheduled (23:00)
**Daily Summary:** No Telegram commands pending. Build was clean. Found and fixed one broken button on the Home page.

### Telegram Commands Processed
None pending.

### Agenda & Findings
| # | Priority | Task | Status | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 | Build health check | ✅ | `npx next build` clean, no errors |
| 2 | 🔴 | Code audit — broken functionality | ✅ | Home page "+ Log a Match" empty-state button had `onClick={() => {}}` — did nothing |
| 3 | 🟢 | Scan for other no-op handlers / TODOs | ✅ | None found elsewhere in `src/` |

### Issues Found
- 🔴 [src/app/page.tsx:327](src/app/page.tsx) — "+ Log a Match" button in the empty Recent Matches state was a no-op. Users clicking it got no feedback or modal.

### Improvements Made
- Wired the Home page's "+ Log a Match" button to open `LogMatchModal` (same modal already used by the Topbar's "Log Match" button), with local `logOpen` state. Verified in browser: clicking now opens the full match-logging flow (QR scan, opponent search, scores).

### Critical Alerts
None.


**Daily Summary:** First log entry — bootstrapping the logbook. No automated session has run yet. This entry documents the app's current state as a baseline for future daily checks.

### Current App State
- **Pages:** Home, Players, Leaderboard, Tournaments, Chat, Player Profiles
- **Auth:** localStorage-based email auth
- **State:** All in AppContext (in-memory, lost on refresh)
- **Deploy:** Netlify static export from GitHub `main`
- **PWA:** Installed, service worker active, app icons live

### Known Issues (as of today)
| # | Severity | Issue | Affects |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔴 | Data not persisted — all state resets on page refresh | Every page |
| 2 | 🟠 | No real backend — changes only exist in current browser session | Auth, matches, clubs |
| 3 | 🟡 | Service worker may cache stale assets after deploy | PWA users |
| 4 | 🟡 | QR scan only matches seed players (UID must be in PLAYERS array) | Log Match |
| 5 | 🟢 | Avatar initials only — no photo upload | Profiles, Chat |

### Today's Agenda (no session ran — baseline only)
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md with full history
- [x] Create DEVLOG.md (this file)
- [ ] Set up daily automated schedule

### 📊 Daily Summary (18:00)
- Sessions run: 1 (Session 4 — Tournament Overhaul, Home Redesign, QR Scan, PWA; see CHANGELOG.md)
- Total fixes deployed: 4
- Build status: ✅ Healthy
- Telegram summary: ✅ Sent
