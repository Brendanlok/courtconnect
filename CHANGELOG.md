## [2026-07-15] — Fix: real 1:1 chat showed the other person as generic "Player"

### 🔴 Chat participant display
**Why:** The RLS-tightening migration (0003) added `users_public` for cross-user reads but
missed this one call site — found while following up on a note left during the club-limit fix.

- `loadParticipantsMap` now reads from `users_public` instead of the owner-read-only `users`
  table, so real conversations show the other person's actual name/tier/MMR/photo again.

---

## [2026-07-15] — Fix: per-user tier club limit bypassable via club-admin actions

### 🟠 Club tier-limit enforcement
**Why:** Same bug shape as the max_members fix, found by a targeted follow-up pass — a club
owner accepting a request or inviting a player could push that user over their own tier's club
count limit, since only the self-join paths checked it.

- `addClubMember` (`supabaseService.ts`) now also enforces `maxClubsForTier` on the target user,
  reading their tier via `users_public` since the caller is often not that user.

---

## [2026-07-15] — Fix: club membership could exceed its own max_members cap

### 🟠 Club capacity enforcement
**Why:** Autonomous bug-hunt found the owner's Accept/Invite paths had no capacity check at
all — only the self-serve Join button did, and only in the UI, not the underlying function.

- `addClubMember` (`supabaseService.ts`) now enforces `max_members` once, covering all four
  paths that route through it (self-join, accept request, admin invite, accept invite).

---

## [2026-07-15] — Feature: Pose-tracking heatmap Phase 1 (camera-view tap tracking)

### 🟡 Court tracking UX
**Why:** Tapping a separate abstract diagram while also watching the live camera feed was
unnecessary context-switching. Lok approved a one-time 4-corner calibration tap in exchange for
tapping the real camera picture directly.

- New `src/lib/courtCalibration.ts`: one-time 4-corner tap → homography → accurate court
  position from any camera angle. Self-check at `courtCalibration.selfcheck.ts`.
- `ClipRecorder.tsx`: opt-in `courtTapMode` — tap the live video to calibrate, then to mark
  positions. Other consumers of `ClipRecorder` unaffected.
- `CourtTrackModal.tsx`'s two-phone tracking flow now offers this alongside the existing
  abstract-diagram tap surface.

---

## [2026-07-15] — Fix: Live Match results permanently stuck "Pending", doubles MMR wrong

### 🔴 Live Match MMR pipeline
**Why:** Autonomous bug-hunt found Live Match's result-logging diverged from Log Match's
working pattern in four ways, all stemming from treating demo/seed opponents as if they could
confirm a match like a real account.

- Every Live Match result against an opponent (Live Match only ever offers demo/seed players)
  was permanently stuck "Pending" — MMR never applied, Confirm button never rendered.
- Doubles Live Matches used the wrong opponent's solo MMR instead of averaging both teams, and
  never recorded partner identities.
- Live Match never applied the placement K-factor or advanced placement match count.
- Anti-cheat's weekly-opponent-cap rule counted your own doubles partner as an opponent.

---

## [2026-07-12] — Backend migration: Firebase → Supabase

### 🔴 Full backend cutover (not yet deployed — pending user review)
**Why:** User data already migrated to Supabase Postgres; app code needed to follow.

- Replaced Firebase Auth + Firestore + Storage with Supabase Auth + Postgres + Storage across the whole app (`src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/lib/supabaseService.ts`, `AuthContext`, `AppContext`, and every consuming screen/component).
- Firestore's `onSnapshot` listeners → Supabase Realtime `postgres_changes` channels.
- Removed the `firebase` dependency and Firestore-only test scaffolding.
- See DEVLOG for the full list of shipped changes, known gaps, and verification performed.

---

## [2026-07-09] — Live Match: Pause/Resume, Camera Layout, Point Log

### 🟠 Live Match — Pause & Resume Instead of Discard on Quit
**Why:** Telegram feedback — quitting mid-match (video or manual) only warned that progress would be lost; the user wanted an actual pause/resume instead of a dead end.

- Added `'paused'` to `LiveMatch.status`. Quitting a live match in progress (video or manual scoring) now sets the match to `paused` in Firestore instead of abandoning it — dialog copy updated to explain this.
- The join code + record mode are remembered locally so the plain "Live Match" setup screen shows a "Paused match" card (score, game, teams) with **Continue Match** / **Discard** — Continue restores the exact score state and drops straight back into scoring.
- Non-host viewers still get a plain "Quit" with no pause (pausing is a host-only action).

### 🟡 Live Match Camera — 1/3 Score, 2/3 Court
**Why:** Telegram feedback — the score header ate a large fixed slice of the screen, leaving too little room for the court in view.

- Video-record camera view now splits 1/3 (score header) / 2/3 (camera/court), instead of a fixed-height header. Playback controls now overlay the bottom of the court area (gradient backdrop) rather than reserving their own strip.

### 🟢 Live Match — Simplified Point Log Labels
**Why:** Telegram feedback — the per-rally point log table's "1a"/"1b"/"2a" labels were redundant since row color already shows the side.

- Point log cells now show just the running tally ("1", "2", "3"...); row color (emerald/rose) still distinguishes teams.

**Files changed:** `src/types/index.ts`, `src/components/LiveMatchModal.tsx`, `src/components/ClipRecorder.tsx`

---

## [2026-07-09] — Multi-Club Membership (MMR-Tiered)

### 🟠 Clubs — Multi-Club Membership Gated by MMR Tier
**Why:** Users could only belong to one club at a time. Product decision: allow multiple, with higher-MMR players earning the ability to join more.

- Club limit by tier: Beginner/Bronze = 1, Silver/Gold = 2, Platinum = 3, Diamond = 4, Elite = 5.
- Replaced the single `myClubId` model with `myClubIds: string[]` throughout — `AppContext`, the Clubs tab, club detail page, and the public profile's club card (now shows all of a player's clubs, not just one).
- `leaveClub` now takes a club ID (was global/no-arg). `joinClub`, `requestJoinClub`, and `acceptClubInvite` all check the tier limit (pending requests count toward the limit too, so you can't queue past your cap).
- "Create Club" and "Join"/"Request" buttons now disable with a "club limit reached" message instead of "already in a club" once at cap; a running "X/Y clubs joined" count shows on the Clubs tab.
- Migrated the old single-club localStorage/Firestore key (`cc_myClubId` / `myClubId`) to the new array-based one (`cc_myClubIds` / `myClubIds`) with a fallback read so existing users don't lose their club on upgrade.

**Files changed:** `src/lib/utils.ts`, `src/lib/firestoreService.ts`, `src/context/AppContext.tsx`, `src/app/players/page.tsx`, `src/app/clubs/[id]/ClubDetailClient.tsx`, `src/app/players/[username]/PlayerProfileClient.tsx`

## [2026-07-04] — Session 4: Tournament Overhaul + Home Redesign + QR Scan + PWA

### 🟠 Tournament Page — Full Overhaul
**Why:** The tournament page had flat, cluttered filter pills and several missing features (bracket always visible, no participant list, no venue suggestions, no way to distinguish hosted events).

- **Filter Dropdowns** — replaced all flat pill rows with 3 categorized `FilterDropdown` components: Visibility (All Events / Public / Private), Format (All Formats / MS / WS / MD / WD / MX), Eligibility (All MMR Levels / Eligible for Me). Consistent with Players and Leaderboard tabs.
- **"Request to Join" icon** — changed from `EyeOff` (eye) to `Plus` icon for semantic correctness.
- **Live Bracket only when Active** — bracket was previously shown for Upcoming + Completed. Now only rendered for `status === 'Active'` (live tournaments). Prevents spoilers and confusion.
- **Participant list for Upcoming tournaments**
  - Public: shows "X players signed up" + clickable "View" button → opens numbered participant modal with capacity bar
  - Private: shows count only with "Names hidden" label — protects participant privacy
  - Registered seed data added (t2: 8 names, t3: 20 names, t4: 4 names)
  - When user registers/unregisters, their name is added/removed from the live list
- **Venue autocomplete** — typing 2+ characters in the Venue Address field shows up to 5 matching Malaysian badminton venue suggestions (Sport Planet PJ, Bukit Jalil, Stadium Shah Alam, etc.). Click to fill.
- **Hosted-by-user highlighting** — tournaments created by the current user get amber border + "You're hosting" badge + float to top of any list. Host sets `hostUid: 'me'` on create.
- **User not auto-registered as host** — creating an event does not sign you up as a player. You can register separately or just manage.

**Files changed:** `src/types/index.ts`, `src/lib/data.ts`, `src/context/AppContext.tsx`, `src/app/tournaments/page.tsx`

---

### 🟡 Home Page — Visual Redesign
**Why:** The home page felt empty and soulless — plain text, grey stat cards, no personality, nothing actionable.

- **Hero Player Card** — replaces plain greeting with a rich card featuring: subtle green/amber glow backdrop, name + tier badge + location, MMR displayed prominently top-right, tier progress bar, two status toggles redesigned as compact inline buttons
- **Quick Actions row** — 3 large tappable tiles: Find Match (green/Zap), Find Partner (violet/Users), Events (amber/Trophy). Each navigates to the right page.
- **Upcoming Events section** — only appears if you've registered for events; shows each as a clickable amber card with venue + date
- **Stat row** — cleaner 3-column grid (Nat. Rank, Win Rate, Matches) with icons; discipline MMR (MS/MD/MX) as compact chip row below
- **Better empty states** — "No matches yet" shows racket emoji tile + "Log a Match" CTA; activity empty state shows icon + "Browse events →" link
- **Richer activity feed items** — Win/Loss as rounded squares with colored backgrounds, MMR changes as colored pill chips

**Files changed:** `src/app/page.tsx`

---

### 🟠 QR Code — Real Generation + Photo Scanning
**Why:** "Scan Opponent QR Code" was a non-functional button. QR codes in My QR Code modal were decorative SVGs with no actual data.

- **Real QR generation** — QRModal now uses `qrcode` library to draw an actual scannable QR code on a `<canvas>`, encoding `{"uid":"me","username":"lokkai","displayName":"Lok Kai"}`. Replaces the decorative hand-drawn SVG.
- **Photo-based scanning in Log Match** — two buttons: "Take Photo" (opens rear camera on mobile via `capture="environment"`) and "Upload Photo" (file picker for gallery)
- **Client-side decode** — `jsqr` reads pixel data from the image drawn on an offscreen canvas. No server, no internet required. Dynamically imported to avoid SSR issues.
- **Auto-fill on success** — decoded `uid` or `username` matched against player database → Opponent field filled automatically
- **Three scan states** — Scanning (spinner + thumbnail), Success (green banner + player name), Error (red banner + reason + retry buttons)
- **Packages added:** `jsqr`, `qrcode`, `@types/qrcode`

**Files changed:** `src/components/QRModal.tsx`, `src/components/LogMatchModal.tsx`

---

### 🟡 PWA — Progressive Web App
**Why:** The app is a mobile-first product but had no installability, no offline support, and no app icon — it looked like a website.

- **App icon** — custom SVG design: dark slate background + emerald green badminton racket (with string grid) + amber shuttlecock with white feathers. Generated as PNG at 10 sizes: 72, 96, 128, 144, 152, 192, 384, 512px + maskable (Android adaptive icons) + Apple touch icon (180px)
- **Web App Manifest** (`/manifest.json`) — `display: standalone` (removes browser chrome), `orientation: portrait-primary`, `theme_color: #059669` (emerald status bar on Android), `background_color: #020817` (splash screen), App Shortcuts: "Find Match" → /players/, "Events" → /tournaments/
- **Service Worker** (`/sw.js`) — precaches app shell on install, network-first for navigation (fresh when online), cache-first for static assets (fast loads). Old caches cleaned on each deploy.
- **Layout meta tags** — Apple Web App capable, status bar style, tile color, favicon chain
- **Install:** Android Chrome: banner after visit or ⋮ → "Add to Home Screen". iOS Safari: Share → "Add to Home Screen"

**Files changed:** `src/app/layout.tsx`, `public/manifest.json`, `public/sw.js`, `public/icons/*`, `scripts/gen-icons.mjs`

## [2026-07-03] — Session 3: Player Profile, Chat, Topbar, Leaderboard

### 🟠 Player Profile — Multiple Button Fixes
- **Edit Profile button** — wired to open `SettingsModal` (was non-functional)
- **Message button** — `onClick` navigates to `/chat/?uid={player.uid}`. Chat page creates new conversation if none exists for that uid, or opens existing one.
- **Challenge auto-open** — chat header Challenge button navigates to `/players/{username}/?challenge=1`; profile reads `?challenge=1` on mount and auto-opens `ChallengeModal`
- **Skill Match tooltip** — hover reveals popup explaining what skill match % means, shows actual MMR gap, gives qualitative label (⚡ Very even / 🟡 Moderate gap / 🔴 Large gap)
- **Skill Match label** — "Skill Match" text added above the progress bar in PlayerRow

### 🟠 Player Endorsements (DUPR-inspired)
**Why:** DUPR lets players endorse each other for specific skills, adding social credibility to profiles.
- 6 skills: Powerful Smash, Sharp Net Play, Great Footwork, Strong Defense, Smart Placement, Good Sportsmanship
- Endorsement counts shown as bar chart on player profiles
- Click to endorse, click again to remove (toggle)
- Endorsed skills show violet with ✓, hover turns red as "remove" cue
- `myEndorsements` and `playerEndorsements` in AppContext
- Seed data on p1 (Zack), p4 (Sarina), p6 (Khoo Hui Jin)

### 🟡 Community Feed
- `COMMUNITY_FEED` seed data (6 match results between players)
- Home page Activity section gets "Mine" / "🌐 Community" tabs
- Community tab shows recent match results from across the platform

### 🟡 Filter Dropdowns (shared component)
- New `FilterDropdown<T>` generic component in `src/components/ui/FilterDropdown.tsx`
- Replaces all flat pill button rows across Players, Partner Finder, Clubs, Leaderboard tabs
- Click-outside closes, active filter shown in emerald tint

### 🟡 Leaderboard Green Frame Fix
- Was `border-l-2 border-emerald-500` (left-only, conflicts with `divide-y`)
- Fixed to `shadow-[inset_0_0_0_1.5px_rgba(16,185,129,0.35)]` — inset box-shadow creates even 4-side border without layout impact

### 🟡 Chat — Message Button Flow
- Chat page `useEffect` on mount reads `?uid=` param
- Finds existing conversation or creates new one client-side
- `[ME, ...PLAYERS]` lookup so all known players can be started with

### 🟡 Location Switching in Topbar
- Location area is now a clickable button with `ChevronDown`
- Opens `LocationPicker` dropdown: GPS detection (`navigator.geolocation`) + manual state/city picker
- `coordsToState(lat, lng)` maps GPS coordinates to Malaysian state/area without external API
- Save calls `updateUser({ state, area })`

---

## [2026-07-02] — Session 2: Clubs Overhaul + Notifications + Partner Finder

### 🔴 Club System — Full Overhaul
**Why:** Clubs had no real functionality — no creation flow, no join/request system, no admin tools.

- **Create Club modal** — name, short name, description, purpose (Competitive/Recreational/Training/Social/Youth), state, max members, min MMR, public/private
- **Join flow** — Public clubs: direct join button. Private clubs: "Request to Join" → pending state
- **Share club link** — copy URL with `?tab=clubs&id=` query param
- **Admin controls** — accept/decline pending member requests
- **Club announcements** — admin can post announcements; **only visible to club members** (not public/non-members). Explicitly fixed after initial implementation showed announcements to everyone.
- **Seed data** — 5 clubs: KL Smashers (competitive, public), PJ Aces (social, public), Penang Eagles (elite, private), Subang United (recreational, public), Johor Blazers (training, private)

### 🟠 In-App Notifications
- `NotificationPanel` component (slide-in from topbar bell icon)
- 8 notification types: challenge received/accepted/declined, partner request, club request/accepted/declined, match pending
- Unread count badge on bell icon
- `addNotification`, `markNotifRead`, `markAllNotifsRead` in AppContext
- Triggered by challenge send/accept, club join requests

### 🟡 Clubs — "Request to Join" icon fix
- Changed from `EyeOff` to `Plus` icon (semantic improvement, carried forward to tournaments)
